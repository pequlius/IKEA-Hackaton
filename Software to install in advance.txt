1. The Processing programming environment version 2 or later:
https://www.processing.org/

2. The Arduino IDE, preferrably the Arduino 1.5.8 BETA, as we have some arduino Yun boards 
http://arduino.cc/en/main/software

3. Drivers for Phidgets:
http://www.phidgets.com/docs/Operating_System_Support

4. Add the Java libraries for phidgets to your Processing library folder
the library file (phidgets21.jar) is in the Github folder or here: 
http://www.phidgets.com/downloads/libraries/phidget21jar.zip
The default location in Windows is: ...\Documents\Processing\libraries\
Add subfolders so that the complete folder structure reads ...\Documents\Processing\libraries\phidget21\library\phidget21.jar

Now you should be able to run the examples in the GitHub when you have the hardware plugged in
